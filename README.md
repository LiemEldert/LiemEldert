## Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Liem, and I'm a 1/4 Computer Engineering major at Stevens!

## Some projects I've been working on lately:

** Unfortunently with the courseload from school, its been hard to find time to work on both. **

### Micromanage
* MicroMDM based open source device management platform
* Written with Next.JS and FastAPI
* Very work in progress, but with plans to support agents for other systems in addition to Apple MDM.

### Everything I do is hosted almost entirely on my own hardware
* I have a Proxmox cluster made up of old enterprise PCs I liberated from the trash room.
  * Thousands of perfectly usable computers are thrown away because it's the easiest option for companies
  * Especially with planned obsolesence, more perfectly usable electronics are being thrown away than ever.
  * Even if it's just a couple of systems, it still means they won't make end up in a landfill, wasting away, while wars are being fought over the little remaining resources left.
  * Ignore the wire spaghetti, please.
    * I've been trying to condense things down to something I can take with me to college and run off a cell hotspot.
    * I have zero open ports and run everything through tailscale to an nginx proxy in DigitalOcean so things can run with CG-NAT.
     * This is crucial because its running off the campus network and hotspot.

I primarily work in Python and Typescript, and typically use Next.JS for webapps.

Feel free to ask me if you need anything!
