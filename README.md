## Hey there ðŸ‘‹
**My goal is to solve problems I see with my skillsets**

## Some projects I've been working on lately:

### BetterMSA
* BetterMSA is a browser extension to add features to Blackbaud's MySchoolApp, which is a common LMS used in many independent schools.
* Unfortunently, it fails to meet a lot of expectations.
* BetterMSA originated as a really simple script that I made after one of my trans friends asked me if there was a way to remove their deadname from the site completetly.
* Unfortunently, there is no easy way to do this, and involved parental consent which is something that isn't possible for people in unsupportive families.
* But I've since widened the scope to include other features that I hope to get working soon like schedule improvements and better ways to visualize assignments.

### Quark
Quark is a simple 3d WebGL renderer I wrote for a school project.
I started working on it after I realized that I didn't have a full understanding as to how 3d rendering works, and there's no better way to learn it than to do it myself.
