## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

## Some projects I've been working on lately:

### BetterMSA
* BetterMSA is a browser extension to add features to Blackbaud's MySchoolApp, which is a common LMS used in many independent schools.
* Unfortunently, it fails to meet a lot of expectations.
* BetterMSA originated as a really simple script that I made after one of my trans friends asked me if there was a way to remove their deadname from the site completetly.
* Unfortunently, there is no easy way to do this, and involved parental consent which is something that isn't possible for people in unsupportive families.
* But I've since widened the scope to include other features that I hope to get working soon like schedule improvements and better ways to visualize assignments.

### Quark
* Quark is a simple 3d WebGL renderer I wrote for a school project.
* I started working on it after I realized that I didn't have a full understanding as to how 3d rendering works, and there's no better way to learn it than to do it myself.

### Everything I do is hosted almost entirely on my own hardware
* I have a Proxmox cluster made up of old enterprise PCs I liberated from the trash room.
  * Thousands of perfectly usable computers are thrown away because it's the easiest option for companies
  * Especially with planned obsolesence, more perfectly usable electronics are being thrown away than ever.
  * Even if it's just a couple of systems, it still means they won't make end up in a landfill, wasting away, while wars are being fought over the little remaining resources left.
  * Ignore the wire spaghetti, please.
    * I've been trying to condense things down to something I can take with me to college and run off a cell hotspot.
    * I have zero open ports and run everything through tailscale to an nginx proxy in DigitalOcean so things can run through CG-NAT.
